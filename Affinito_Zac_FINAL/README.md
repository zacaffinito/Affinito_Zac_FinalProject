# Affinito_Zac_FinalProject

Make a calorie tracker using pygame. The final product should be able to have calories entered, save that information, and then bring up a calendar view showing current and previous entries on given dates.

## Description

The pygame calorie tracker uses a simple system of key presses in order to pull up the tracker and previous entries. To add calories, simply press "a" and denote the date, press enter twice, then denote the number of calories consumed. To bring up the calendar, press "d" and then enter the desired date. the calender brings up the entered date, and the previous week's entries as well.


### Dependencies

* Windows 10, os, pygame


### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets

use vscode to run the program with python (pygame)
follow instructions given in the window

## Help

Any advise for common problems or issues.
- often the main menu window pops up more than it should - if this is the case and other functions stop working, try pressing enter a few times, and then the code likes to comply
- when adding calories sometimes the window comes autofilled with date information - simply delete the date and enter the calories - it should all work out in the end
